# Concilium

**A multiplayer AI-assisted development workflow replacing JIRA's agile model.**

## Concept

Instead of throw-it-over-the-wall ticket workflows, Concilium creates a *living ticket* where stakeholders progressively shape a feature through AI-mediated collaboration:

1. **Multiplayer prompting session** — Engineer, Designer, Product Owner (and others) weigh in on a ticket over time
2. **Progressive refinement** — Each persona contributes from their expertise; the prompt/ticket evolves
3. **Consensus threshold** — When enough stakeholders approve, the system *builds* based on the combined feedback
4. **Self-improving** — Cron-driven autonomous feature development continually improves the product

## Personas

- **Engineer** — Feasibility, architecture, implementation approach
- **Designer** — UX, visual design, interaction patterns
- **Product Owner** — Priority, scope, business value
- **QA** — Edge cases, test scenarios, acceptance criteria
- (Extensible — add ops, security, accessibility, etc.)

## Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **State**: localStorage (client) ↔ SQLite (server, via better-sqlite3)
- **Data**: SQLite via better-sqlite3, persisted in `data/concilium.db`
- **AI**: DeepSeek V4 Flash / V4 Pro via llm.ts, with persona-aware mediation

## Status

🏗️ **v0.8** — Granular notification preferences. Mute notifications by type or by persona. Settings accessible from prompt session header.

### What Works
- Ticket dashboard with persona status indicators and consensus progress bars
- Ticket detail page with stakeholder feedback panel
- Per-persona feedback entry (Engineer, Designer, PO, QA)
- Approval tracking and consensus visualization
- New ticket creation flow (with field validation and character counters)
- Seed data with realistic multi-persona feedback
- **AI-mediated prompting session** — write raw thoughts, DeepSeek V4 Flash mediator refines through persona lens
- **LLM-powered mediator** — DeepSeek V4 Flash-powered persona-aware response generation (concerns, recommendations, follow-ups)
- **`/api/prompt` route** — GET for session context, POST for mediation
- **Multi-turn conversation** — follow-up question chaining within a session
- **Consensus auto-build trigger** — auto-transitions draft→in-review→consensus→building→done
- **Dark parchment design system** — unified `ink-*`, `bg-*` (raised/elevated/deep), `gold`, `olive`, `cardinal`, `blue-steel` tokens across all components
- **Build report viewer** — `/build/[id]` page with structured requirements, design decisions, QA criteria
- **Build auto-completion** — when the LLM generates the build report, the ticket auto-transitions to "done" (no manual step needed)
- **Build complete celebration** — animated confetti particles and status display when a build finishes
- **Full autonomous pipeline** — draft → in-review → consensus → building → done, all automatic
- **SQLite backend persistence** — all tickets, feedback, and build reports stored in `data/concilium.db`
- **Server-side CRUD API** — `/api/tickets`, `/api/feedback`, `/api/sync` RESTful endpoints
- **Client-server sync** — client automatically syncs localStorage to server DB on every write
- **Server-side mediator** — `/api/prompt` and `/api/build` use persistent SQLite data instead of ephemeral in-memory store
- **Seed data migration** — localStorage data pushed to server on first client load
- **🎮 Real-time session presence** — BroadcastChannel-powered presence tracking shows who's in a prompt session, which persona they're using, and how long they've been there
- **Persona claim system** — prevents duplicate persona claims; shows available/unclaimed personas for quick-join
- **🔔 Multiplayer notifications** — in-app notification store with cross-tab sync; browser Notification API integration for feedback submissions, consensus reached, and build completions
- **Notification bell** — unread badge in prompt session header; persistent across tabs
- **⚡ Real-time feedback streaming** — when one persona submits feedback, it appears instantly in all other session participants' chat timeline without refreshing. Live indicator badge shows "X just submitted" with pulsing dot. BroadcastChannel-powered, zero infrastructure needed.
- **🔕 Granular notification preferences** — mute notifications by type (feedback, consensus, build) or by persona (don't notify when Engineer submits). Accessible via gear icon in prompt session header. Cross-tab sync, persisted to localStorage.

### Next Up
- Edit history and version diffing for ticket descriptions (VersionHistory, DiffView components exist, need integration into ticket detail page)
- Add notification preferences UI to the dashboard settings area
- Notification grouping in the notification bell dropdown
- Cross-session feedback import (reuse persona feedback from similar tickets)

## Development
